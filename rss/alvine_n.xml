    <content>💯 agree!!!focusing on compound exercises is more effective than doing abs workouts every day, especially if your goal is overall core strength and aesthetics.  But that doesn’t mean you should completely neglect ab-specific exercises. It’s good to incorporate them into your routine but not necessarily every day. You can include dedicated ab workouts 2-3 times a week to target the tummy muscles directly. If fat loss is your goal balance diet with a calorie deficit is a must it will help reduce body fat &amp; make your tummy flat .
