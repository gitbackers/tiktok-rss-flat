    <content>Replying to @nadia #greenscreen  thank you so much though for calling me out i want to make sure i don’t say things that offend anyone especially women who look like me, and have the same hair struggles, figuring out what worked best for me took a lot of trial and error and I wanted to just give tips on how to save time when you’re in college. Even when I wore my sew in I would wait until my roommate wasn’t there to restraighten my hair and if she was there, I would let her know the room may get hot because of the flat iron. I still washed my hair when I lived on campus but once a week just so I could save time and do what I actually enjoyed instead if worrying my hair. But still do what works best for you💞💞</content>
