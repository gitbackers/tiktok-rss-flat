    <title>Replying to @xso2hvn Puberty blockers, like when used to treat precocious puberty, actually give trans youth exactly what you suggest--more time to be children while they figure out next steps.</title>

    <title>Replying to @aylin2x3 I think there are a lot of ✉️ anti-racists who understand how you are feeling about this. I hope you'll eventually be able to center working towards solution over discomfort. It's a very freeing and inclusive space on the other side.</title>
