    <content>#stitch with @Food Science Babe 👈🏼 See the original video here ☝🏼☝🏼 I was not paid to communicate this evidence based information regarding aspartame. Just because someone may get paid to communicate accurate, evidence based information doesn’t automatically mean the information is false. If a paid partnership is not disclosed properly, that is a valid issue, but that also doesn’t mean the information is incorrect. If you’re attempting to refute information stated in a paid partnership, simply saying or implying it’s wrong because it’s a paid partnership is not a valid refutation to the actual information. If you are of the opinion that someone shouldn’t be doing a specific paid post, you are entitled to that opinion, but that still is not a refutation to the actual information in that post. #factsnotfear #sciencecommunication #aspartame </content>
