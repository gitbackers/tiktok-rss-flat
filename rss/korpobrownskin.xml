    <content>your goal right now is to grow thicc rounded Bunda and you're less than 1200 calories per day then of course you're not going to see encouraging results If you're goal right now is to lose weight but also want to grow your glutes while in the process then there is nothing wrong with eating in calories deficit because that's how you'll achieve your weight loss( and if you approach what you eat daily then you can literally RECOMPOSITION your entire body while loosing weight ) Most times we apply all the right gym methods but forgetting nutrition play a huge part to our fitness journey, if you're eating as low 1200 or less calories per day for whatever your goals are and expecting to make progress that is also nearly impossible because your body need fuel and food is the fuel, reasons why i tell my Besties to have balance diet. You need fuel to have you lift heavy and push through your cardio. Eat well and turn those food into good gains by being active. I know it's hard hearing you need to eat in order to see progress, I used to be one of those people who think eating very little food will make me not fat, lose weight or gain weight so I totally get it. Most times you also don't even know what to eat or how much calories you're even taking per day , it's time to stop fearing food especially if you haven't seen much progress in your journey. Listen, If you haven't been seeing progress in the gym If you've been lacking motivation to train If you're wondering why you're not building any muscle If you've been worn out, tired or lethargic If you're frustrated with feeling overwhelmed or burnt out Join my team first link ‚¨ÜÔ∏èüîó in my bio to sign up for my 60 day program and custom meal plan.
