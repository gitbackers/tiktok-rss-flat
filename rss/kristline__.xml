    <content>Make dinner with me for bae &amp; me. Power by @Bloom Nutrition  __ I recently visited PR for the 2nd time and on this trip not only did I experience some new food but I was able to pick the chef brain on how  the cassava &amp; plantain was made, the texture was phenomenal.This is cassava &amp; plantain Mofongo. It was love at first taste for me __ This meal was one of their specials and honestly, it was so delicious that I had to come home and attempt to making it for my husband. Added a few of my touch.</content>
