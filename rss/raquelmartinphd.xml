    <content>I find that envy and jealousy often get confused.  Envy deals with wanting something that someone else has.  While jealousy has a distinct feeling of resentment regarding what someone else has. It's always incredibly helpful to investigate the feelings that arise.  Do not assume that this somehow makes you a "bad" person.  It doesn't.  Think about why you want that item, and let it drive you forward.  How can you work towards obtaining something similar.  Also, ask yourself, do you want the item, what it represents, or how that item makes the person feel?</content>

    <content>You should be talking to your children about sex AND sexuality. They’re not the same thing. There’s a difference between the physical acitivity involved in intercourse and sexuality.  Sexuality is a much broader topic and it involves sexual orientation, preferences, and experiences. Sexuality also deals with how an individual perceives and expresses their sexual self via aspects of their identity, orientation, roles, and activities. Talking about sex and sexuality does NOT mean your child will go out and smang everyone in sight. It DOES mean that they’re more likely to advocate for themselves, communicate effectively, and feel empowered in their choices.</content>
